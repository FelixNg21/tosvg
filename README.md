# ToSVG

ToSVG is my attempt at writing a python program that converts a photo to a SVG. 
A colouring book webapp (currently unhosted) is also present. 


# TODO
- Host the webapp.
- Add functionality to upload/download the image.
- Make the python script usable. With my current knowledge, it is not enough.
